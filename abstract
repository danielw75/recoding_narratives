The purpose of this research is to address the issue of diversity in the design world, exposing the need for revising our current paradigms. This study examines current events and data from the tech and creative industry that show a glaring lack of diversity in the field, and explains how this hinders creativity and innovation. This essay pairs theory and evidence to reveal that the best pathway to the future is the “recoding” of established design narratives through the celebration of a wider chistory with diverse role models and greater opportunity for non-normative design cultures.
